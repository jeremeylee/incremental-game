This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Incremental Game

This project was based on the concept of an incremental game. The player can increment a value and use that value as currency to purchase upgrades that increase the rate of accruing the currency.

## Purpose

I built this project in order to practice using react and redux.

## Future Changes

I plan to add data visualization with d3 to the "Home" tab in the future in order to get more familiar with d3.

However, there are no future plans to develop the progression of the game any further. I only wanted to develop the core gameplay mechanics of an incremental game.
